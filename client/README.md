# Event Management App

## Overview

This is a React-based Event Management application that allows users to register, sign in, create events, and view their own events. The app features protected routes, socket communication, and state management with Redux.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and sign in to access protected features.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Event Management**: Users can create, update, delete, and manage events.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses `socket.io` for real-time updates, including attendee updates.
- **State Management**: Implements Redux for managing user state and real-time event updates.
- **Image Uploads**: Uses Cloudinary for handling image uploads.
